      You decide to fight!! You see how quickly the beast is approaching you and
      you clench your fist. As it gets close you begin to swing at it, but just before your
      fist connects with it... it vanished... You look around confused, you assume you must have been drugged or have a
      serious lack of sleep.
      but as you turn to head back into the bar you suddenly feel a pain unlike any pain you have ever felt
      in your back. You turn your head and see the beast standing inches behind you. You feel your life fade away... as
      the world goes to black.
      The End
